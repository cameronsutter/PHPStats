 * @section intro Introduction to PHPStats
 * PHPStats is a statistical library for PHP.  Its goal is to implement
 * statistical functions in PHP that are not covered in the PHP core.
 * PHPStats is written entirely in native PHP for ease of installation
 * and for use in shared hosting environments, where the installation
 * of binary files is difficult, if not impossible.
 *
