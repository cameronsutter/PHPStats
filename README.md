PHP Stats
=========

A Fully Featured Statistical Library for PHP

Inspired in part by fantastic libraries such as SciPy and in part by the
difficulty in getting additional binaries installed in a shared hosting
environment, PHPStats aims to extend and fill gaps in PHP's core mathematical
functions.  The library is built for both a frequentist mind-set and a Bayesian
mind-set.  It also contains a number of financial classes intended to speed the
implementation of PHP projects in a business setting and to raise PHP's profile
in enterprise intranet applications.

This software is ALPHA quality, if that!  It is under heavy development right
now and may undergo significant changes to its interface, including the possible
split of the financial functions into a separate library.  Please do not use in
a production setting without fully vetting it first.  PHPUnit tests are included
for regression testing and for proving the correctness of the code in a new
setting.  PHPUnit test coverage is still highly incomplete and entire sections
of code are known to fail.  If you are testing sections of code for which unit
tests do not exist, please consider doing your testing in the form of unit tests 
and submitting those tests for inclusion in the test suite.
